                <h3>5.1 Payment</h3>
                <p>All payments for our Guide are considered purchases of digital content. All purchases are processed through our payment processor (PayPal) and are subject to their terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Temporary Payment Implementation:</strong> Please note that our current payment system temporarily utilizes PayPal's donation button for processing transactions. Despite this technical implementation, all transactions are considered purchases, not donations. This is a temporary measure while we expand our payment methods. You will receive the Guide promptly after your payment is processed, regardless of the button type used for the transaction.</p>
                
                <h3>5.2 Pricing and Taxes</h3>
                <p>All prices are displayed in United States Dollars (USD). For EU customers, applicable Value Added Tax (VAT) will be calculated at checkout based on your country of residence, in accordance with EU VAT regulations. Detailed information about the final price, including any applicable taxes, will be provided before the purchase is completed.</p>
                
                <h3>5.3 Right of Withdrawal</h3>
                <p>In accordance with Article 27 of the Polish Consumer Rights Act of 30 May 2014, Consumers have the right to withdraw from a distance contract without giving any reason within 14 days of concluding the contract.</p>
                
                <p>However, in accordance with Article 38(13) of the Polish Consumer Rights Act, the right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the Consumer's prior express consent and acknowledgment that they thereby lose their right of withdrawal.</p>
                
                <p>Before purchasing our digital Guide, you will be explicitly asked to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consent to immediate access to the digital content</li>
                    <li>Acknowledge that by giving this consent, you lose your right of withdrawal</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>If you do not give this consent, delivery of the Guide will be delayed until the 14-day withdrawal period has expired.</p>
                
                <p>If you are entitled to and wish to exercise your right of withdrawal, please contact us using the information provided in Section 20.</p>
                
                <h3>5.4 Refunds</h3>
                <p>If you believe there is a defect in the Guide or it does not conform to what was advertised, please contact us immediately. You may be entitled to a repair, replacement, price reduction, or refund in accordance with Polish warranty laws.</p>
